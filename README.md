# Web Visualization Dashboard 


## Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also  a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website 

The website consists of 11 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Eight visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Visualizations" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides three more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, "Data" which links to the data page, and "Repo" which links to the GitHub repository used to create the plots.
* Is responsive (using media queries). 

The website is deployed to https://harpreet1020.github.io
